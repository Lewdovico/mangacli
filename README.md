# mangacli
A bash script to view manga in your command line.

I created this script because I wanted to view my favorite manga on sxiv.

## Requirements

1. curl
2. jq
3. sed
4. cut
5. pup
6. cat
7. grep
8. awk

## Installation

Download the above mentioned requirement first (if not present).
Download this repository or use git clone

```
git clone https://github.com/abhilash26/mangacli.git
```

```
cd mangacli
chmod u+x mangacli
```
For repeated use it is better to add this script to the bin folder or any folder which exists in PATH variable.

## Usage

```
mangacli <search term>
```
or 
```
./mangacli <search term>
```

Sorry readm.org for using your site. 

A lot of optimizations and UX is needed on this. 
Also I wouldn't mind adding in more sites.
